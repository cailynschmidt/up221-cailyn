Greetings! My name is Cailyn, I am a first year MURP with a concentration in Climate, Environment and Society. I spent the past few years co-founding and laying the foundation for an environmental nonprofit organization in Honolulu, Hawai ªi called Aloha Tree Alliance. Through my time with the nonprofit, I managed and coordinated the restoration of a degraded watershed at the urban forest interface by mobilizing hundreds of community members to plant thousands of native trees/plants for the health and well being of the community and also the ecosystem.  
My work at the intersection of urban forestry, indigenous land use, community health, and urban greening inspired me to get my masters in Urban Planning. When I wasn ªt planting trees, engaging volunteers, and hiking, you could find me swimming, hiking or doing yoga by the beach. I am a lifelong musician (piano, cello, voice, Javanese Gamelan), new yoga teacher and I have a passion for cooking and feeding people.

# **Course Description** üìö
I am taking this course to learn how to use GIS mapping to plan for environmental restoration projects at the urban forest interface. I also am interested in learning  how to translate complex environmental data in our urban setting (such as heat, biodiversity, tree canopy coverage, etc) and easily turn it into accessible, visually aesthetic data for community members, decison makers, and policy developers. 

# **Project Ideas** üí°
I am currently conducting research on the cultural ecosystem services of trees planted in schoolyards in Los Angeles. Some project ideas I have for this class are the following: 
1) Mapping the relationship between public health disparaties (asthma, obesity, food insecurity) and access to green spaces (tree coverage, parks, recreation) in Los Angeles
2) Mapping potential native tree cooridor connectivity in Los Angeles 
3) Understanding the spatial distribution of grocery stores and urban gardens in Los Angeles to understand which communities are more vulnerable to food insecurity

# **Objectives** üìù
My personal objectives are to not be scared by python and coding and embrace the collaborative spirit of this course! Looking forward to working with you all this quarter!
